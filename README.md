# Book Library üìö

A simple Angular application to manage a collection of books. This app allows users to list, add, edit, and delete books. Built using Angular best practices, including modular architecture, lazy loading, dependency injection, and reactive forms.

> Generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.2.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure Highlights

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `CoreModule` | Singleton services like `BookService`, `LoggerService`, `NotificationService` |
| `LibraryModule` | Feature module for managing books (lazy-loaded at `/library`) |
| `SharedModule` | Reusable components, directives, and pipes (if needed) |

## üîÅ Book Service Implementations

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `HttpBookService` | Connects to a mock REST API (e.g., json-server) via HTTP |
| `InMemoryBookService` | Uses an in-app array for local testing/development |

Easily switch between them by updating the provider in `CoreModule`.

## üí° Design Principles Used

- **SOLID principles**: Interfaces, single-responsibility services, dependency injection.
- **Angular best practices**: Lazy loading, interceptors, route resolvers, reactive forms.
- **Clean architecture**: Feature modules, service abstractions, testing support.
- **Separation of concerns**: UI, logic, data access are all decoupled.
